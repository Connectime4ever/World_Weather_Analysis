# World_Weather Analysis

## Overview:

#### Improving the features of PlanMyTrip app, by adding additional data for the users to refine their experience when trying to choose their preferred travel destination.
#### In this sense, weather description data has to be added to the initial code for the Beta testers to filter the data based on their weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
#### Testers would also be able to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
#### Aditionally, a travel route among the four cities would be created with a marker layer map by using Google Maps Directions API.
